# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Here it goes!
 
The weather app must have all the basic functions, including city name, current weather icon, temperature, etc. It must display the recording of both high and low temperatures of each day, including apt images for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy weather conditions. It should have a responsive design and refresh each time the browser is refreshed or every five minutes with the exact temperature and weather conditions.
 
Optional functionalities :
 


	
Include the functionality wherein the user can click on a particular day of the week to see the hourly forecast.
	Add React Router to the app (npm install react-router). Check out the quickstart guide to add routes. For instance, routes that can display the 5-day forecast, along with the name-of-day and the hourly forecast for that day.
	Sign up on the Open Weather API to obtain a free API key and to fetch a 5-day forecast. Then feed this data in your app.
	 

Ahi va, tampoco os lo tomeis al pie de la letra, he pillado un enunciado que encontre por ahi y le cambie un par de cositas.
 
Para los componentes si quereis hacerlo todo a mano adelante pero tambien podeis usar una libreria de componentes externa como ant design, material ui, semantic ui, tailwind... os lo dejo a vuestro criterio
 
Para los datos pues si quereis mockearlos al principio pues todo mockeado, sino pues teneis la Open Weather API que esta bastante guay para obtener datos
